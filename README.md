# Configuration files

These are my shared configuration files for software I frequently use. It
includes installation scripts to create or update the tools that are not
installed by default on a clean system.

## Location

The repository should be cloned to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` which should be kept as
`~/.config` for simplicity. None of the files should assume this though.

## Installation

Run the relevant `INSTALL.*` script to set-up the tools.
